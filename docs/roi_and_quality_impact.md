MTTR reduced by 30–50%
Assignment accuracy increased
Reduced duplicate troubleshooting
Improved SLA compliance


ROI 
This solution helps solve problems faster and with less effort. Since incidents are automatically sent to the right team from the beginning, there is less time wasted in checking, reassigning, or repeating work. As a result, the average time to fix issues (MTTR) is reduced by 30–50%, and support teams spend less time and money on the same problems.

Quality Impact
The quality of support improves because incidents reach the correct team on the first attempt. Support engineers can quickly understand the issue using references from similar past incidents, which reduces mistakes and delays. This leads to faster fixes, more consistent solutions, and better user satisfaction.
